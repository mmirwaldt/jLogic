# logic_experiments
Some experiments with propositional and predicate logic in Java

Goals:

Propositional logic
* express propositions
* prove by truth tables
* convert to canonical conjunctive form
* convert to canonical disjunctive form
* prove by resolution
* prove by method of analytic tableaux 
* optimize by Karnaugh map

Predicate calculus
* express predicates
* convert to prenex normal form
* convert to Skolem normal form
* prove by resolution
* prove by method of analytic tableaux

Limits:
- No support for L2+ high order logic planned (I am no theoretical computer scientist ;-)
