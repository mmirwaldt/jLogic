* prove by truth tables
* convert to canonical conjunctive form
* convert to canonical disjunctive form
* prove by resolution
* prove by method of analytic tableaux 

Predicate calculus
* express predicates
* convert to prenex normal form
* convert to Skolem normal form
* prove by resolution
* prove by method of analytic tableaux
